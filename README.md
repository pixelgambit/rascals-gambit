# Rascal's Gambit

Pixel art roguelike solitaire dungeon crawl for Android/iOS (Godot 4)

Inspired by Scoundrel by Zach Gage & Kurt Bieg — descend through a deck-dungeon, fight monsters with your weapon, collect diamonds, and survive as long as possible.

Based on game mechanics from Scoundrel (used with respect — this is a fan-inspired adaptation).
